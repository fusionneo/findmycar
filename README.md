# Find My Car  🚗
Often times we are in the market for a car, but only have an ideal price range, and a few specifications in mind. The hard part is when we have to choose a specific make and model of car.

Find My Car is the web application that will provide you with personalized car recommendations based on your preferences.
Now that you have chosen your car, you may want to know the car’s safety ratings or if the car has had any recalls from the manufacturer. Find My Car will take care of both of these for you at the click of a button.
