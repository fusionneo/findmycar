# Find My Car offers the customers a unique experience 
where they have an option to look for safety and recall 
information on any vehicle of their interest without having 
to log in as we believe this information should be made 
available to all potential buyers but is mostly disregard 
by automotive dealers. Customers also have the option to 
log in and search for information about cars of interest 
after matching the parameters given by the user.

## We achieved all this by using different technologies.

A) New technology requirement was fullfilled by using 
npm’s Axios for the Api’s fetch’s.

B) NPM’s bcrypt was used as our password-hashing 
function throughout the app.

C) Connect-session-sequelize, a SQL session store using 
Sequelize.js was also used for storing session (persistent storage - Postgres) .

D) NPM’s dotenv was used as a zero-dependency module to loads 
environment variables from a .env file into process.env. 
Storing configuration in the environment separate from code.

E) NPM’s Express was used for its robust high performance 
routing, high test coverage as well as its ability to 
support many template engines.

F) NPM’s express-session was used an HTTP server-side 
framework used to create and manage session middleware used.

G) NPM’s express-handlebars was used to render web 
pages to the client side from data on the server-side.

H) MySQL-2 was used to add , access, and process 
data stored in the computer database.
